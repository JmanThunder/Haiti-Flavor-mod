transition_1;Demographic Transition: Stage 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_1_desc;In Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), death rates are low and birth rates diminish, as a rule accordingly of enhanced economic conditions, an expansion in women's status and education, and access to contraception. The decrease in birth rate fluctuates from nation to nation, as does the time span in which it is experienced. Stage Three moves the population towards stability through a decline in the birth rate. Several fertility factors contribute to this eventual decline, and are generally similar to those associated with sub-replacement fertility, although some are speculative;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_2;Demographic Transition: Rural Areas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_2_desc;In rural areas continued decline in childhood death means that at some point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and care for them in old age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_3;Demographic Transition: Urbanization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_3_desc;Increasing urbanization changes the traditional values placed upon fertility and the value of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family. A recent theory suggests that urbanization also contributes to reducing the birth rate because it disrupts optimal mating patterns. A 2008 study in Iceland found that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins. Genetic incompatibilities inherent in more distant outbreeding makes reproduction harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_4;Demographic Transition: Education and Children;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_4_desc;In both rural and urban areas, the cost of children to parents is exacerbated by the introduction of compulsory education acts and the increased need to educate children so they can take up a respected position in society. Children are increasingly prohibited under law from working outside the household and make an increasingly limited contribution to the household, as school children are increasingly exempted from the expectation of making a significant contribution to domestic work. Even in equatorial Africa, children (age under 5) now required to have clothes and shoes, through the body, and may even require school uniforms. Parents begin to consider it a duty to buy children(s) books and toys, partly due to education and access to family planning, people begin to reassess their need for children and their ability to grow them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_5;Demographic Transition: Status of Women;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_5_desc;Increasing literacy and employment lowers the uncritical acceptance of childbearing and motherhood as measures of the status of women. Working women have less time to raise children; this is particularly an issue where fathers traditionally make little or no contribution to child-raising, such as southern Europe or Japan. Valuation of women beyond childbearing and motherhood becomes important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_6;Demographic Transition: Contraceptives;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
transition_6_desc;Improvements in contraceptive technology are now a major factor. Fertility decline is caused as much by changes in values about children and gender as by the availability of contraceptives and knowledge of how to use them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
